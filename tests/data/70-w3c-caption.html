A simple test of head + body catenation, with mixed <tt>th</tt> and <tt>td</tt> elements. <p>
Near-verbatim from section 4.9.1.1 of the W3C spec, with a slight alteration (we've set the second cell in the header to be a TD rather than a TH, to verify that our parser can admit cells of either kind, regardless of section type).
